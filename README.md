# OnlineNewsReader

A prototype project that retrieves news articles from NewsAPI.org and displays them via an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

Included is the ability to filter the articles by keyword and publish date, as well as simple sorting.

The solution should run via IIS Express without the need to make any configuration changes, although a few NuGet packages need to be restored (this should happen automatically during the Build of the solution).
